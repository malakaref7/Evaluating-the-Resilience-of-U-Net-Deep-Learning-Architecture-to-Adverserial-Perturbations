## Introduction

Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like U-Net, are widely used for image segmentation tasks. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can cause them to produce incorrect outputs. This project investigates the robustness of the U-Net architecture to such adversarial perturbations and proposes methods to enhance its resilience.
