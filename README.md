## Introduction
Deep learning models like U-Net are widely used for image segmentation tasks but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This project investigates the robustness of U-Net to such perturbations and proposes enhancements to its resilience.


## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
bash
git clone https://github.com/malakaref7/Evaluating-the-Resilience-of-U-Net-Deep-Learning-Architecture-to-Adverserial-Perturbations.git
cd Evaluating-the-Resilience-of-U-Net-Deep-Learning-Architecture-to-Adverserial-Perturbations
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
### Data Preparation
Prepare the dataset by running the appropriate preprocessing steps found within the Jupyter Notebook.

### Model Training
Train the U-Net model using the provided notebook.

### Adversarial Evaluation
Generate adversarial examples and evaluate the model's performance using the notebook.

Run the notebook with:
bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Robustness_of_U_Net_Against_Adversarial_Attacks.ipynb


## Results
Detailed results, including performance metrics and visualizations of adversarial examples, are documented in the notebook `Robustness_of_U_Net_Against_Adversarial_Attacks.ipynb`.
